# Working-With-Downloaded-Data
Use the command line to extract and manipulate data downloaded from the internet.

In this project, I'll be working with an education dataset in ZIP format. I'll extract the files inside and work with them.
The dataset I'll work with, called the Civil Rights Data Collection, contains information on educational achievement and opportunities in the US, broken down by race and school. For example, the dataset contains information the number of students of each racial group are enrolled in advanced classes in each school. 
Each row is a different school, and each column is an indicator of academic achievement.

For the purposes of this exercise, we'll be using a version of the data set that only contains 1 out of every 100 rows in the original data set.
