1. Using Pandas To Find Patterns In The Data:-

In order to explore any interesting patterns here, we can use Series.value_counts() to find unique values in each column. This will tell us how many schools are juvenile justice facilities or magnet schools.

We can also count up how many students are in juvenile justice facilities by building a pivot table using the pandas.pivot_table() function. The pivot table will allow us to aggregate TOT_ENR_M, and TOT_ENR_F, which contain the total enrollment in the school of men and women, by JJ and SCH_STATUS_MAGNET. This will count up how many students are in magnet schools, or in juvenile justice facilities.

The output pivot table of division of Juvenile Justice (JJ) based on gender is given below:-

	TOT_ENR_F	  TOT_ENR_M
JJ
NO	252915		266702
YES	71		    427


2. Using Pandas To Explore Enrollment By Race:-

There are several columns in the data that indicate school attributes broken down by race and gender. 
These start with the attribute name, like SCH_ENR, which indicates school enrollment. They then add a racial codename, like BL. Finally, they add a gender codename, like F. To put our example together, we get SCH_ENR_HI_F, which is hispanic female enrollment in the school.

The proportion of total enrolled students based on gender and race that I found is given below:-

    hispanic_male                   - 0.134426040395
    hispanic_female                 - 0.127152648933
    native_american_male            - 0.00725031964085
    native_american_female          - 0.00689847437586
    asian_male                      - 0.0257404612441
    asian_female                    - 0.0246964613595
    hawain_pacific_islander_male    - 0.00180536996626
    hawain_pacific_islander_female  - 0.00188419868683
    black_male                      - 0.072085980985

    white_male                      - 0.257075838997
    white_female                    - 0.2413850783 
    two_or_more_races_male          - 0.0152120204186
    two_or_more_races_female        - 0.0152658546668
